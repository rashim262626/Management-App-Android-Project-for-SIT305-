We are creating a Management Application specifically targeted to the managers of any organisation. 
The Manager will be able to manage all the shifts, rosters, tasks, add a new employee or fire an existing one. 
The manager will also be able to send an email to inform his employee about any changes in roster, etc.
We will use database in it. There will also be server side coding in it to store data and fetch data of employees.
We will also add Facebook/ Google connectivity for sign in and sign up purpose. 
We will further add more features as the works goes on.
